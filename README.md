BattleGrounds
=============

A game made for school with integration from JavaScript to HTML
Still needs some smoothing out with what game you are even playing to the results and other images
that you will be seeing on screen. For now its a console.log, so open that up for the results!

This is free to mode, add to, whatever... I am learning to code and this was one of my first games 
that now I am plugging into and interface on the web. More to come as I involve more CSS and jQuery 
functionality.
